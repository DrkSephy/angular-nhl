A Web Application built using MEAN (MongoDB, Expressjs, Angularjs, Nodejs) for the sake of learning new technology.

#### Goals
* Learn to pull data from an API and build an express application
* Store data into MongoDB for use by Angular
* Render team data using Angularjs

#### Resources for learning Express, Mongo and Node
