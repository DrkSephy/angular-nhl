A Web Application built using MEAN (MongoDB, Expressjs, Angularjs, Nodejs) for the sake of learning new technology.

#### Goals
* Learn to pull data from an API and build an express application
* Store data into MongoDB for use by Angular
* Render team data using Angularjs

#### Research 

In order to start building this application, we must find a way to obtain data for teams, rosters, and more through an API which (hopefully) returns JSON. Some possible resources for this are shown below:
